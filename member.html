                <p class="travelf">Friendship Travel: it’s all in the name.  Friendly holidays for like-minded people who happen to be single, or would otherwise be holidaying alone. I founded Friendship Travel in 1999, so in 2018 we are celebrating our 20th year in buisness and we decided we should do it in style!</p>

            <h1>Friendship</h1>
            <p>The first Friendship Travel season featured just one property in Turkey: it was a hectic summer!  Since then we have arranged holidays for tens of thousands of single travellers and believe, thanks to listening to our guests, that we have the balance just about right.

Our philosophy is simple - We package beautiful destinations with comfortable surroundings and great people: our Friendship Travel Hosts and the good company of our single travellers. The resulting holidays are relaxing, fun and friendly.

Friendship Travel was the first singles holidays company to offer double rooms for sole occupancy – as standard.  We were the first to launch a Chat Room on our website, and the first to Video real single travellers talking about their holiday experiences. We also developed the first ‘holidays for single travellers’ smart phone app.

But for all the innovation and techy stuff, Friendship Travel remains focused on personal service and experience.  Our small team is on the other end of the phone, happy to share their experiences with you; between us, we’ve sampled all our holidays and hotels. </p>
